# I help my teams succeed
## I can justify the way I work in a business context

### Reflect: What does it mean to justify the way you work in a business context?

- Be able to relate design and organisational decisions to high-level goals and priorities
- Validate your choices in relation to your objectives
- Get frequent feedback from product owner

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

### Can you say this about yourself?

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

#### Acebook

- Checked in with Michael regularly that he was happy with the features we had implemented
- Invited Michael as product owner to sprint planning meeting to discuss priorities.
- Made suggestions on some amendments to previous feature requests on the basis that we could reduce maintenance burden with little change in the user experience. He thought this was fine and agreed to our suggestion.
- Suggested adding the ability to search for users as a good next feature to implement on the basis that we'd already implemented user walls, but the feature was not that useful unless you could look for users. Discussed with Michael, and he agreed we should proceed on that basis.

### What feedback have you had?

Michael?
