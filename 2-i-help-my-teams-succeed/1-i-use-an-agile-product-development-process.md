# I help my teams succeed
## I use an agile product development process

### Reflect: What does it mean to have an agile development process?

Agile is a software development methodology which is iterative, incremental, and collaborative. Typical features of an Agile process may include:
- Sprints: a short (e.g. 2 weeks, but more like 2 days for our compressed projects), time-boxed period where the team works to implement a specific set of features
- Minimum viable product: a product with some minimal set of features, sufficient to show to stakeholders in order to rectify incorrect assumptions and get feedback for further development cycles.
- Stand-ups: short meetings at the start of the day where team members address briefly what they did yesterday to help meet the team's goal, what they will do today, and any blockages they forsee.
- Self-organising: the team themselves decide how best to organise their work to meet their goal. Tasks are not assigned to team members - team members decide which tasks to prioritise.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

At the end of week 8 I will have collected feedback from my team members to confirm that we did the following:
- Worked in sprints with well-defined goals.
- Worked towards a well-defined MVP.
- Had daily stand-ups where we kept it short!
- All team member actively participated in the organisation of our work.

I will also be able to point to evidence from our Trello board to support this.

### Can you say this about yourself? Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

### What feedback have you had?

Greg's feedback
> As per point 4 of twelve points of agile development, your communication skills are excellent. You are able to express complicated ideas and break them down in a way which is comprehensible for those working at a lower technical level. You recognise the value of working in a team and were able to both deepen my understanding when appropriate, while also taking a technical lead role when required in order to deliver the goals of the project, as decided by the whole group.

> As per point 6, you showed appreciation, trust and a commitment to empowering others throughout the project. It was very easy to work productively alongside you.
