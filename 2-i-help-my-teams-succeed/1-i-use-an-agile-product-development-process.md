# I help my teams succeed
## I use an agile product development process

### Reflect: What does it mean to have an agile development process?

Agile is a software development methodology which is iterative, incremental, and collaborative. Typical features of an Agile process may include:
- Sprints: a short (e.g. 2 weeks, but more like 2 days for our compressed projects), time-boxed period where the team works to implement a specific set of features
- Minimum viable product: a product with some minimal set of features, sufficient to show to stakeholders in order to rectify incorrect assumptions and get feedback for further development cycles.
- Stand-ups: short meetings at the start of the day where team members address briefly what they did yesterday to help meet the team's goal, what they will do today, and any blockages they forsee.
- Self-organising: the team themselves decide how best to organise their work to meet their goal. Tasks are not assigned to team members - team members decide which tasks to prioritise.
- Communication very important (XP values). Communication within the team and with the product owner.
- Continual improvement: what went well, what can we improve?

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

At the end of week 8 I will have collected feedback from my team members to confirm that we did the following:
- Worked in sprints with well-defined goals.
- Worked towards a well-defined MVP.
- Had daily stand-ups where we kept it short!
- All team member actively participated in the organisation of our work.

I will also be able to point to evidence from our Trello board to support this.

### Can you say this about yourself?

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

#### Acebook

- We worked in two sprints, with a sprint planning meeting at the start where we broke features down into user stories to work on, and retros where we reflected on what went well in the previous sprint, and what we wanted to improve
- Regularly checked in with product owner for feedback on what we had implemented, and discussions of where we should be heading next
- Switched pairs and features so that members of the team can share knowledge with each other, and by working on different parts of the system
- Set up a wiki so team members can share learnings about Rails and the app, and document the conventions we were using
- Use Trello Kanban to keep track of tickets we were working on with a defined process for how we move tickets along, mark as blocked, mark as ready for review. Used Trello/GitHub integration to manage pull request review process.
- All pull requests reviewed by two people. Good for code quality and for sharing information.

### What feedback have you had?

#### Acebook, Jeremy

He said the workshop I arranged for the group to learn about Rails architecture and flow was very helpful for learning about Rails. He enjoyed my presentation style, and appreciated how I engaged everyone in the discussion.

He felt I had taken a leadership role in the group, and done a good job of bring everyone together and ensuring we're all working on different parts of the app and in different pairs so that knowledge gets shared throughout the group. When there were bottlenecks we dealt with them through mobbing which meant the whole group was engaged. He also appreciated the wiki that I instigated as another method of sharing knowledge among the team.

#### Makers BnB, Greg Paul

Greg's feedback
> As per point 4 of twelve points of agile development, your communication skills are excellent. You are able to express complicated ideas and break them down in a way which is comprehensible for those working at a lower technical level. You recognise the value of working in a team and were able to both deepen my understanding when appropriate, while also taking a technical lead role when required in order to deliver the goals of the project, as decided by the whole group.

> As per point 6, you showed appreciation, trust and a commitment to empowering others throughout the project. It was very easy to work productively alongside you.

#### Acebook, Michael (coach)

After inviting Michael to our sprint planning meeting we asked him if we showed that we can use agile development processes, can justify the way we work, and were able to justify decisions we were making in a business setting. He said:
