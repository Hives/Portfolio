# I help my teams succeed
## I grow collaboratively

### Reflect: What does it mean to grow collaboratively?

Most software development takes place in teams. Your team will support you to do your work, and your team will do better if you can support them to do their work.
- Be able to give constructive feedback
- Be able to take feedback on board
- Communicate clearly and effectively
- Share knowledge with your team
- Actively seek knowledge from team
- Commitment to empowering other team members to contribute

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

Some stuff I/we've done in our team this week:
- Organised a workshop for the team to learn about Rails together where we produced a diagram of Rails' MVC architecture, and the flow of an HTTP request response/cycle
- Get all members contributing to and reading team wiki and README
- Consciously tried to pair with different members of the team to ensure other team members have worked on and gained knowledge of different parts of the app.
- Make sure all members are particpating in code reviews so that they understand all parts of the app.

### Can you say this about yourself?

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

### What feedback have you had?

#### Pairing feedback, Matt Thompson

Matt said he found that I gave clear explanations of some concepts. For example my explanation of instance variables and `attr_reader` was very helpful in helping him to understand them. He also appreciated my patience when we were going over areas like that that he didn't understand yet.

#### Pairing feedback, Amy Jordan

> You are a very calm and steady partner to work with, always willing to share your knowledge and time with everyone from the cohort. ... I really appreciated that you were happy to go at a pace that worked for me, as a total newbie to this topic. It was great that you led the session while still providing time and space for me to work things out. I felt there was a good balance of giving me enough time/space (and then prompters) to work something out and then showing me something in action when I got stuck - the mix of the two helped me cement my understanding throughout the afternoon. Likewise, when we got onto content we both weren't familiar in, we worked together actively, sharing ideas and trying things out to see how things might work - this was fun! ... You're a great pair and a pleasure to work with ðŸ™‚

#### Pairing feedback, Harry Galliano

> You were a really patient partner which was fantastic as you already seem to know lots about programming and you were very calm the whole way through the afternoon which really helped me to keep going and keep focused. I think the thing you did best was that you would always get me to try my ideas, even when they didn't work, this was great for me being able to visualise exactly why some of my ideas didn't work and you were then kind enough to explain the syntax to me, which was fantastic.

#### Makers B'n'B team feedback, Greg Paul

> As per point 4 of twelve points of agile development, your communication skills are excellent. You are able to express complicated ideas and break them down in a way which is comprehensible for those working at a lower technical level. You recognise the value of working in a team and were able to both deepen my understanding when appropriate, while also taking a technical lead role when required in order to deliver the goals of the project, as decided by the whole group.

> As per point 6, you showed appreciation, trust and a commitment to empowering others throughout the project. It was very easy to work productively alongside you.
