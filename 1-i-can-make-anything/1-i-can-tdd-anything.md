# I can make anything
## I can TDD anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to TDD anything?

- To understand the red/green/refactor cycle
- To not write any code unless it's to pass a test (preferably a feature and unit test together)
- To only write the minimal code to pass your tests
- To design your tests in such a way as to drive you towards a solution
- To be able to apply this process confidently independently of language and test framework, including in unfamiliar languages
- To be able to make unit tests for classes be independent through dependency injection/doubling/mocking

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

At least 3 projects with solid examples of TDD, including:
- At least one which shows tightly linked feature and unit tests where I wrote the feature test, wrote a unit test to generate the same error, then wrote the minimal code to fix both errors.
- At least one with good examples of dependency injection/doubling/mocking to make unit tests for different classes independent. Bonus points for manually creating mock objects (Can point to my Java `WeatherDouble` class as an example of this, or my mock objects for News Summary Challenge.)
- Example of where I test-drove a project without using a testing framework
- Example of test-driving in an unfamiliar language (Airport Challenge in Java)

In addition - a good video of me TDDing a kata, e.g. from a process workshop. And ask a coach, "If I did this in an interview, would it come across well?" Haven't got one of these yet.

### Can you say this about yourself? Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

#### Something in Ruby

What's the best example? [Takeaway Challange](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge)? The README says it uses BDD, and it had some external dependencies stubbed out in the tests. Seek feedback from coaches on this.

#### Airport Challenge in Java

<https://github.com/Hives/java-stuffs>

TDD in Java using JUnit and Mockito, having never used Java before. All user stories and edge cases implemented, using a BDD process

#### News Summary Challenge (JavaScript)

<https://github.com/hives/news-summary-challenge>

TDD-ing without the aid of ~~a safety net~~ a test framework.  Revisit this and generally tighten up. Flesh out my test framework, incuding implementing `before`/`describe`/`context`/`it` blocks.

#### Airport Challenge in JavaScript

<https://github.com/Hives/airport-challenge-javascript>

TDD in JS, using Jasmine. Possibly include just as an example of another framework?


### What feedback have you had?
