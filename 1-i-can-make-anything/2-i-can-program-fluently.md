# I can make anything
## I can program fluently

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to program fluently?

Being able to translate a specification into code within a reasonable amount of time, having a process to unlbock yourself if you get stuck. This is a skill that encompasses many of the other ones.

Skills that contribute to this:
- Being able to analyse and model a domain
- Understanding programming concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, SRP, TDD etc... and being able to use them to translate a specification into code
- Knowing specifically how to implement those things in a particular language, or else knowing how to find out in a language you don't know
- Having a process for unblocking yourself when you get stuck
- Having a solid debugging practice
- Optimising your tools to enable you to translate your ideas into working code with as little friction as possible

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

Examples where I completed work in unfamiliar languages, using my conceptual and process knowledge to enable me to research the specific language-based knowledge I needed to implement a task.

Examples of tools I use - Zsh; Vim and my `.vimrc`; iTerm panes; `.alias` file for commonly used commands; Ranger - terminal file browser; active learning and configuring of keyboard shortcuts; Karabiner for rebinding of keys like Ctrl/Esc instead of Caps Lock, and Super when holding tab

### Can you say this about yourself? Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

I think this is kind of an umbrella skill, so examples from other goals will apply, but...:

#### Bowling

I implemented multiple approaches, some test-driven and some spiked in order to explore different approached to implementing the program.

#### Airport Challenge in Java

TDD-ed Airport Challenge from user stories to completion in new language.

### What feedback have you had?

Matt T was impressed with how fast I was working when he processed reviewed me, which was Vim + iTerm panes + nifty keyboard shortcuts
