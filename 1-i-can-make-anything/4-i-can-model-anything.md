# I can make anything
## I can model anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to model anything?

Two different things:
- Being able to break any complex problem or domain down so that you can understand how to implement it
- Being able to do the same so that you can communicate the idea to other people

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

Some good opportunities for this in the Rails Acebook app. From the learning goals:
- Diagram a high-level view of Rails MVC architecture
- Compare and contrast to another MVC framework
- Diagram the sequence of events when you run rails server
- Diagram a request and response cycle of a user interacting with the rails app

Do this and get coach feedback.

And... do this, present it to team members, see if they understand it - check by asking them to explain it back, or draw their own diagram.

I diagrammed a two-MVC domain for Amy - one MVC running in a browser, and a second MVC running on a server, presenting an API to the first one. She seemed to get it - should ask her for feedback.

Are my modelling diagrams useful to explain to other people

### Can you say this about yourself? Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

Examples of models I've made:

- [Flow diagrams of bowling scoring](https://github.com/Hives/bowling-challenge/tree/master/attempt-02) - one flow diagram with high level blocks broken down into secondary flow diagrams
- [Domain modelling for MakersBnB](https://github.com/makers-bnb/makers-bnb#domain-modelling) - breaking down user stories into nouns and verbs, then a class diagram to investigate what classes and methods we would need, and how they would interact
- [Domain modelling workshop](https://github.com/Hives/makers-notes/tree/master/week-2/workshops/domain-model-diagramming-workshop#what-we-did) - simple domain broken down into class and sequence diagrams

### What feedback have you had?
