# I can make anything
## I have a methodological process to solving problems

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to have a methodological process for solving problems?

Closely related to the debugging and 'I can learn anything' goals

Method (not necessarily in this order):
- Understand/define the problem. How will you know when you've solved it?
- Analyse the domain
- Research what you need to know to work on the program - read the docs, google it, think about what concepts you know will come into play
- Think about different approaches/ ways to solve it. Which one looks best? According to what criteria? After you've started working on does your opinion change?
- Break your chosen approach down into small steps

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

- Re-use debugging stuff as evidence of methodological problem solving
- Bowling challenge - implemented a number of different approaches to explore the solution space, including a few quick spiked solutions before test-driving the final approach.
- Airport challenge in Java

### Can you say this about yourself? Yes / No

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

#### Bowling challenge

<https://github.com/hives/bowling-challenge>

I explored 5 different algorithms for this project, including a couple of quick spikes before test-driving my final approach. The complexity of the logic of bowling scoring means you have to make a trade off between competing priorities, e.g. simplicity of program flow and encapsulation of responsibilities into separate objects. By exploring different approaches I was able to come up with a solution that had a good balance of delegation of responsibilities with a comprehensible program logic. (Get some feedback on this claim...)

#### Airport Challenge in Java

<https://github.com/Hives/java-stuffs>

I did the airport challenge in a language I had no knowledge of - Java.

My process:
- Google to find a simple tutorial to get started, implement 'Hello World!' and 'FizzBuzz'
- Research Java test frameworks
- Read up on getting started with JUnit
- Test drive 'FizzBuzz' using JUnit
- Now I know enough to get started. Start test-driving Airport Challenge.
- When I find that I don't know how to implement something (doubles, mocks, dependency injection, error handling...) research it, read just what you need to get unstuck, and go back to your code
- Rinse, repeat

### What feedback have you had?

I got some feedback from Katerina on my Java Airport Challenge, but I made a couple of modifications on her suggestion. Need to go back and get some final words to put here.
