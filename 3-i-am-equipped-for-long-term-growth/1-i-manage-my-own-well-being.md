## I manage my own well-being

### Reflect: What does it mean to manage your own well-being?

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

- Walk in to Makers - time to clear my head
- Pursue activities other than coding outside of Makers - playing music, going to sessions, playing gigs
- Take regular breaks. Go for a walk every lunch time - fresh air and stretch the legs
- Get enough sleep - I read a study that said the one thing which all studies show improves the performance of software development teams is not TDD, Agile, writing clean code etc., is getting enough sleep! So I've generally been going to bed much earlier that I was used to before the course, between 10-11 compared to 12-1.
- Yoga
