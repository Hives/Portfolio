# I am equipped for long term growth
## I can learn anything

### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to learn anything?

Have a general process that you can apply when faced with any coding task involving technology where you have no experience.

### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

Airport Challenge in JavaScript (I already knew some JS)
Airport Challenge in Java
I wanna do FizzBuzz in Haskell!

### Can you say this about yourself?

Yes

### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

#### Airport Challenge in Java

<https://github.com/Hives/java-stuffs>

TDD in Java using JUnit and Mockito, having never used Java before. All user stories and edge cases implemented, using a BDD process.

My process for doing this was:

- Google to find a simple tutorial to get started, implement 'Hello World!' and 'FizzBuzz'
- Research Java test frameworks
- Read up on getting started with JUnit
- Test drive 'FizzBuzz' using JUnit
- Now I know enough to get started. Start test-driving Airport Challenge.
- When I find that I don't know how to implement something (doubles, mocks, dependency injection, error handling...) research it, read just what you need to get unstuck, and go back to your code
- Rinse, repeat

This process of building up to the main task through a series of smaller tasks supported by lots of research along could be applied to any project and any tech stack.

I recorded my process for this in [a lot of detail](https://github.com/Hives/airport-challenge-javascript/blob/master/all-the-gory-details.md). Then I made some high-level reflections about learning stuff:
- Have a specific target to aim for. How will you know you've succeded?
- Do the research you need to get started, and then start writing code ASAP. Start exploring, and make mistakes early and often - that's how you learn. (It's how I learn anyway.)
- Leverage what you already know. If you understand e.g. the principle of dependency injection and can apply it in a different language, use that as a starting point for researching how you do it in a new language.
- Read the docs. Sometimes they can be too technical for a newbie, but sometimes they're very helpful. Jasmine docs I found to be excellent.
- Learn to parse your error messages in detail. A new language may give you unfamiliar error messages. Learn to understand them quickly.
- Don't copy and paste stuff form StackOverflow! If you find something helpful, play around with it and research any unfamiliar syntax until you understand it otherwise it may come back to bite you!
- Googling is probably the most helpful single resource, but don't get sucked into reading long articles. Maybe use cmd-f to find the relevent parts on the page take, just what you need and then go back to writing code. You'll cement your knowledge better that way than trying to fully digest a 5,000 word article about the constructor/prototype pattern. That's what I think anyway... YMMV.


### What feedback have you had?

Katerina said after looking at my Airport Challenge in Java that it looked like I had a good general process that I could apply in any situation.
